# Stock-Headlines-Sentiment-Analysis

The project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a labeled dataset containing information about news headlines. Label 1 means that the stock price would increase and label 0 means it will decrease or stay the same. Using these headlines we will train the model using a random forest classifier in order to achieve our objective with high accuracy.
